<!-- Kirsty Duran -->
<p>
    Kristy Duran’s roots in the San Luis Valley go back 180 years or more, making it her home but also a place for her ongoing research. Duran tells us, “Growing up, I always knew this place was special in a way that I could not easily articulate. It wasn’t until I returned to the valley after a 20-year absence, that I began to find the words.” For Landlines, Duran is focused on <i>La Botica</i>, a region rich in botanical diversity located in a remote part of the south valley. <i>La Botica</i> is an archaeological site with a unique ecological setting that sits on a shelf that cannot be seen from the canyon below or the plains above. For Landlines, Duran will share the unique geology and biology of <i>La Botica</i> as well as the stories of the people who visited the land over the past several hundred years.

<!-- Andrew Valdez -->

<p>The San Luis Valley consists of a broad, flat valley floor surrounded by the San Juan and Sangre de Cristo Mountains, as well as the volcanoes of the Taos Plateau.  All these features contribute to a very “scenic” quality to the San Luis Valley. Andrew Valdez takes us into the valley through lidar and spatial scanning helping us to understand the geological processes that created them. As Andrew says, “when you see a beautiful landscape, you're not only seeing shapes, shadows, and scale, you're seeing a story about its formation and why it is there.”</p><p>Valdez is a native of the San Luis Valley where he grew up on a farm near Capulin, Colorado. While studying Geology at Adams State College, he began working with the National Park Service (NPS) at Great Sand Dunes National Monument, which he continued while in graduate school at the University of Alabama. In 1995 Valdez was hired full time at Great Sand Dunes and has been there since. He works with outside researchers who study topics such as dunes on Mars, how dunes form, and mapping subsurface structures. Valdez’s data collection and research program have improved our understanding of how the dunes system works, so that the NPS can better protect this natural resource.</p>



<!-- Chip Thomas: La Isla-->

<p>Chip Thomas creates work under the moniker jetsonorama, and as a long-time M12 collaborator he has been using his time in the San Luis Valley, “learning the history and hearing stories of people in this cattle ranching and farming community with a large population of people who trace their ancestry back to the Spanish colonists who passed through the region beginning in the 1500s.” For the La Isla Schoolhouse project, Chip interviewed a number of elders who went to school in La Isla. Family photos from Walter Perea and others were used as reference images for the murals.</p>



<!-- Chip Thomas: Unsilenced -->

<p><i>Unsilenced: Indigenous Enslavement in Southern Colorado</i> is an installation by artist jetsonorama at History Colorado's Fort Garland Museum and Cultural Center in Fort Garland, Colorado. The installation will be on display in one of the original adobe buildings constructed in 1858. It incorporates historic photos of Indigenous captives and images of former Colorado Lieutenant Governor Lafayette Head's 1865 census of enslaved Indigenous people in Conejos and Costilla Counties. A space in the installation will offer visitors the opportunity to process and offer reflections on the work. The artist's interpretation is part of History Colorado's Borderlands of Southern Colorado initiative. </p><p>Fort Garland was built in 1858, ten years after the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, during the United States’ expansion into the west. Today, visitors can explore the culture of the San Luis Valley and life in a nineteenth-century military fort by walking the parade grounds and touring five of the original adobe buildings. 
</p><p> The Fort Garland Museum and Cultural Center is a museum of History Colorado. Dawn DiPrince, Chief Operating Officer for History Colorado and lead developer of the Borderlands of Southern Colorado initiative, will contribute an essay about this artwork for Landlines. Eric Carpio, Chief Community Museum Officer and Director of Fort Garland Museum & Cultural Center at History Colorado, will also contribute an essay entitled <i>Birth of a Borderlands 1845-1868.</i></p>

<!-- Michael Rael -->

<p>In his photobook <i>Sentinel in Sight</i>, photographer and San Luis Valley resident Michael C. Rael photographs San Antonio Mountain, said to be the largest "free-standing" mountain in the continental United States. San Antonio Mountain marks the southern boundary of the San Luis Valley, where it can be seen from almost anywhere, regardless of distance, because of the flat and unobstructed valley floor. Tewa Indians who first saw the mountain gave it at least two names: Keping (bear mountain) and Pimpije’imping (north mountain). Centuries later, Catholic Spaniards called it Cerro de San Antonio after Saint Anthony of Padua, patron saint of Native Americans, barrenness, horses, lost articles, poor and oppressed people, travelers, and starvation.</p>
