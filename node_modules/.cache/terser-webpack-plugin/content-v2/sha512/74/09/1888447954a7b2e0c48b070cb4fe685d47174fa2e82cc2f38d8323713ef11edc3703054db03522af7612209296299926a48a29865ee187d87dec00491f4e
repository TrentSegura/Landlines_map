It wasn’t until I returned to the valley after a 20-year absence, that I began to find the words.” For Landlines, Duran is focused on <i>La Botica</i>, a region rich in botanical diversity located in a remote part of the south valley. <i>La Botica</i> is an archaeological site with a unique ecological setting that sits on a shelf that cannot be seen from the canyon below or the plains above.

In 1995 Valdez was hired full time at Great Sand Dunes and has been there since.
